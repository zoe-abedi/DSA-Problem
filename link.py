# Python Program for Binary Search (Recursive and Iterative)


# In a nutshell, this search algorithm takes advantage of a collection of elements that is already sorted by ignoring half of the elements after just one comparison. 

# Compare x with the middle element.
# If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.
# Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half.
# Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half.
# Recursive :




# Python 3 program for recursive binary search.
# Modifications needed for the older Python 2 are found in comments.
